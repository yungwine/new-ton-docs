## Install MyTonCtrl

To install MyTonCtrl, run:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
sudo bash install.sh
```
After that, the wizard (interactive CLI installer) will be launched, choose mode.
Once installation performed, launch MyTonCtrl with command `mytonctrl`.

You need to wait until the node is fully synchronized, typically near 2 hours. To check synchronization status using the command:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> status
```

Check the field `Local validator initial sync status: x`, the value should become less than 20.
You can also set up [alert bot](/v3/guidelines/nodes/maintenance-guidelines/mytonctrl-private-alerting) to receive a notification when the node is synchronized.

## Uninstall MyTonCtrl with node

To uninstall MyTonCtrl, run:

```sh
sudo bash /usr/src/mytonctrl/scripts/uninstall.sh
```

## Support
